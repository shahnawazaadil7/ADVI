# Dynamic Matrix Project

This project implements a dynamic matrix class in Python, allowing for the manipulation of matrices through various operations. The main features include:

- Inserting and deleting rows and columns dynamically.
- Multiplying two matrices.
- Computing the transpose of a matrix.
- Efficient handling of edge cases, such as operations on empty matrices or invalid dimensions.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. 

## Usage

The dynamic matrix functionality is implemented in the `matrix.py` file. You can create an instance of the `DynamicMatrix` class and use its methods to manipulate matrices.
